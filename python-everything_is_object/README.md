# Python Objects and Memory Management

## Project Overview
This project explores Python's core concepts regarding objects, memory management, and variable behavior. It focuses on understanding the theoretical foundations of Python rather than coding implementation.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand objects and instances in Python
- Distinguish between mutable and immutable types
- Grasp references, assignments, and aliasing
- Learn how Python handles variable identity and memory
- Recognize how Python passes variables to functions

## Key Concepts Covered
- Object identity vs equality
- Variable references and memory addresses
- Mutability and its implications
- Built-in mutable and immutable types
- Aliasing and its consequences

## Project Structure
The project consists of theoretical questions with answers provided in single-line .txt files.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.5
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- PEP8 style compliance (pycodestyle 2.7.*)

## Approach
1. Read the recommended documentation thoroughly
2. Think and brainstorm about the concepts
3. Answer questions based on understanding, not trial-and-error
4. Verify answers with Python interpreter only after forming theories

## Why This Matters
These concepts are fundamental to Python programming and frequently tested in technical interviews. Understanding them helps prevent common bugs related to object behavior and memory management.
